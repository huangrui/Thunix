About Thunix   
============
  Thunix is an 32 bit Operating System with mostly C and litter assemble 
writen by Aleaxander just for fun. It stands for THUnder phoeNIX. The 
current version is just 0.2.

  Is it Open Source? In a nutshell, NOT. Because it's not the right time now. 
I'll put it to the Open Source list when I get the version 1.0 that looks like 
be an Operating System. For now I have lots things to do for it like add memory 
management, add process support then make it be an Operating System that can run
and compile program on it. But do not be worried about it and do not even think 
about when will the 1.0 version be published 'cause i will put the source code 
of each version with the publication on the website from version 0.2.
