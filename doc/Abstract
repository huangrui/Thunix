This paper describes how to wirte a mini kernel from scratch, which has
the basic featuers that a kernel should have. And they are: protect mode
enabled, so that we can use all the 4G physical memory and it also can
make the kernel much stronger with it's ring protect tech. It contains
basic drivers, such as keyboard driver so that we can input data, floppy
driver so that we can write and read from a floppy, timer driver so that
we have our own soft timerï¼Œ and so on. And of course, it contains a
fs driver. I chose EXT2 fs here, since it has been the native linux fs
for a long time, and it's simple to implement. And that's all I would
talk about, in a low-level way, in this paper.
